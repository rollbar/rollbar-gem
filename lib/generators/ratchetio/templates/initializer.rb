  # By default, Ratchetio will try to call the `current_user` controller method
  # to fetch the logged-in user object, and then call that object's `id`,
  # `username`, and `email` methods to fetch those properties. To customize:
  # config.person_method = "my_current_user"
  # config.person_id_method = "my_id"
  # config.person_username_method = "my_username"
  # config.person_email_method = "my_email"

  # Add exception class names to the exception_level_filters hash to
  # change the level that exception is reported at. Note that if an exception
  # has already been reported and logged the level will need to be changed
  # via the ratchet.io interface.
  # Valid levels: 'critical', 'error', 'warning', 'info', 'debug', 'ignore'
  # 'ignore' will cause the exception to not be reported at all.
  # config.exception_level_filters.merge!('MyCriticalException' => 'critical')
end
