[Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) is a real-time exception reporting service for Ruby and other languages. The Rollbar service will alert you of problems with your code and help you understand them in a ways never possible before. We love it and we hope you will too.

Rollbar-gem is the SDK for Ruby apps and includes support for apps using Rails, Sinatra, Rack, plain Ruby, and other frameworks.
